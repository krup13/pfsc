    "### Question 1 - Image Filter Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You work as a data engineer at a photo analysis company. Part of your pipeline involves applying a grayscale filter to user-uploaded images before analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The current implementation processes each image one at a time, which is too slow for large batches. You decide to speed this up using Python's multiprocessing module, as grayscale conversion is CPU-bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your job is to apply the filter in parallel using `multiprocess`, compare it to the sequential method, and report performance improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Task:  \n",
    "1. Use the function apply_grayscale(image_path) to simulate grayscale processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a list of 10 simulated image file paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use Pythonâ€™s multiprocess.Pool to process them in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compare the time taken for sequential vs. parallel processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Print your conclusion.\n",

    "Task:\n",

    "1. Generate synthetic log files, each with 1,000 lines of random content.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Insert the keyword \"unauthorized access\" randomly in some files.\n",
